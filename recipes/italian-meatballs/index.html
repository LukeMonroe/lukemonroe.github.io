        <h2>How To Make</h2>
        <h3>Step 01</h3>
        <p>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Combine the eggs, Italian seasoning, basil flakes, black pepper, garlic powder, and salt in the large bowl. Mix the ingredients together thoroughly.</p>
        <h3>Step 02</h3>
        <p>Place the ground beef into the large bowl and fold the ground beef onto itself until all the ingredients are evenly mixed.</p>
        <h3>Step 03</h3>
        <p>Line the baking sheet with tin foil and fill the sheet with golf ball sized meatballs. An easy way to make golf ball sized meatballs is to scoop the ground beef out with an ice cream scooper.</p>
        <h3>Step 04</h3>
        <p>Place the meatballs in the oven for 15 minutes. Make sure to turn the meatballs over halfway through the cook time.</p>
        <h3>Step 05</h3>
        <p>Take the meatballs out of the oven. Immediately place all the meatballs into another container to separate them out from the grease on the baking sheet.</p>
        <h3>Step 06</h3>
        <p>Let the meatballs cool off for about 5 minutes and enjoy!</p>
